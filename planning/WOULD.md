# Project Plan

## Walk Through the Project

We need an application to store, index, and retrieve the results of electronic structure calculations performed with the Gaussian 16 software. The application should allow users to capture the key input parameters of each calculation, including the Calculation Type, the Method, the Method Family, the Spin State, the Electronic State, the Basis Set, the Density Fitting Set, the Molecule under consideration, and any additional Keywords used in the calculation. The application should also store the key results of each calculation, and allow users to summarize and discuss the importance or significance of the results.

Individual calculations should be grouped into "Experiments", and these should allow users to enter the overall results, significance, importance, and discussion, much as these things would appear in a research paper.

Users should be able to search for an retrieve records based on the above parameters, including a text search within the results/discussions fields.

While there is no requirement for file storage to store input and output files, the application should store references to these files, and for the desktop application, allow users to open these files in their default application.
